### HOBBIES
I love traveling expercing different cultures meet new people and just get to know people. My travelling experience has not only shaped the manner in which i interact with people but it has changed my perspective about life in general. I have learn to respect people's options, boundaries and learn to accpet them for who they are.

*cooking*  is also one of my favorite thing to do, trying new recipes and seeing the happy expression on their faces gives me so much joy.
