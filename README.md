### HOBBIES
I love traveling expercing different cultures meet new people and just get to know people.

I have learn to respect people's options, boundaries and learn to accpet them for who they are.

_**cooking**_  is also one of my favorite thing to do, trying new recipes and seeing the happy expression on their faces gives me so much joy.

**music** they say is the food for the soul with _gospel_,  _love'srock_,*reggae*,_rnb_ my favorite
